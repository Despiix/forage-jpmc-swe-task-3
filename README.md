# JPMC Task 3
Starter repo for task 3 of JPMC's Forage program

**Task 2 - Describe your thought process and the insights a trader would be expected to draw from this new display:**

My thought process was centred around enhancing the tool's
ability to perform comparative analysis and anomaly detection in real-time stock data.
To do that, I changed the code to compare the relative performance and interactions between 
different stocks (which includes: rations, alerts and upper/lower bounds) rather than just the individual
stock prices it was originally showing.

With the changes mentioned above a trader would be expected to draw the following insights:

- **Comparability of multiple stock prices:** Traders can see which stock or group of stocks is outperforming 
another at any given time, due to the real-time ratio display.

- **Identifying Anomalies:** If the ratio exceeds the upper or lower bound the trader will be alerted. Allowing them to take 
advantage of a trading opportunity or investigate an unexpected price change. Which will result in 
better **decision-making**.

- **Trend Analysis:** The upper/lower bounds allow for long-term analysis showing how stable/unstable the price is,
rather than showing short term anomalies.
